## Motivation

To keep learning, live a life full of adventure and create something of value

## Work

Currently I work as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer at Airbus

## Hobbies

- Body Building (Much recent)
- Tennis
- Programming
- Going for a ride

## What I like

- I love algorithms! I like to make things run faster and efficient with the least complexity
- I learnt a lot of many different things
    - **Laravel** is my recent love, after having tried out the messy world of webdev
    - **Self Deploy** is the new JAM as told by my buddies [@dhh](https://x.com/dhh) and [@levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio)
    - **SaaS** is what I tried to create with BlipHQ and SkillOutreach, but I didn't get good with marketing
    - **React Native/ Flutter** is what I gave a try at, but it's just cheaper to hire someone to do it for you
- Modeling and Simulation is what brought me here. It was an awesome time learning to build robust solvers for PDEs, parallel computing, numerical optimization and linear algebra
